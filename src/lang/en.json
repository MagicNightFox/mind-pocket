Most usually they used notes, todo-lists, shopping lists, communicated with their family about what to buy, if they have something at home or not → and usually what they used was just a basic chat and their phones' note app. \n\n So, I thought about creating something tethered to them, an app that would allow them to create notes that were shared across devices easily, todo-lists, possibly a schedule-manager, daily planner, household management with shopping lists and finances and whatnot."
